Difference between css and scss 

scss is nothing but css with brain. 

we can do all the calculations in the scss 

Example : Material UI , Bootstrap , TailWind 

we have something called styled Components also -> passing css inside the components ( just like props )

HomeWork : StyedComponents. 

In this Session we will be focusing more on the TailWind Css . 

you dont have leave the file to write css you can write css in the same file 

https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation 

1. install the tailwind css "npm install -D tailwindcss postcss"
2. npx tailwindcss init -> when you do this , it will create a tailwind.config.js
3. in the file we just have to bother about content , if you give * inside the content it means that you have to consider about all the files , instead of giving a * give a path which means find a tailwind in this file.
4.create postcssrc , its like a config for my css , we have to activate postcss here.
5. parcel has postcss inside it like parcel has babel inside it , now we have to add an extra config in postcssrc in a way to tell parcel that please add this. 
6. we were writing css till now in styles.css , get rid of all the css and you ll be having only 3 lines , its kind of installing tailwind in css
7. Entire App messed up right :) lets fix it and style the components now :) 
8. lets find a cool logo now
9. brahmastra of tailwind to give us best suggestions is tailwindcss intellisense
10. read more about tailwindcss later , for now am pausing it and moving to next video tutorial , for my purpose i am enabling the style.css now
