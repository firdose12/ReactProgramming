Season 1 : 

Season 2 : 

 what ever we created in season 1 is not a production ready for production it doesn't have any packages , bundles

 NPM : Node package Manager, we need a lot of dependencies to build , we need a place to manage them, thats y we have npm

-> simply give "npm init -y" , it will by default create a package.json with some dependencies
    npm keeps track of everything
-> if you see package.json you can see a basic json structure, earlier we use to indect the stuff using injection in the html using script but lets inject that in package.json

-> instead of injecting the react in the html , let get that in   package.json , 
    "npm i react react-dom" , what happened ? we got package-lock.json and node modules etc 
    and you can see in the package.json its updated because npm does that for us , it also 
    maintians the latest version of what ever you install.

    what is dependecy ? what do our project need from outside is dependency.

-> other things also came up while installing what are those ? those are dependencies over dependencies which has other dependencies
